ToDo:
Fixes:
- find a faster way than writing and removing from DOM. Instead, try to just edit attributes and redraw
- Figure out why collisions seem to be energy net positive

Additions:
- Basic GUI to customize
- Functionality to easily add and remove obstacles (walls, aisles, etc). Basically be able to draw rectangles and not have points spawn in them
- Visualization of the numbers rather than just counters (graph like on the Wapo article)
- Make each simulation a callable function with params so we can do different instances and restart etc
- make all the collision measurements based on dot radius so that size can change freely for different sims
